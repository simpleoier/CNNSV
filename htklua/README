A small script written in c++11 to write a lua table into a binary and on the other hand to read in an htkfile to a lua float tensor.

Installation:
You need to install the script at your local torch installation. Therefore you can access the functions anytime, as long as you use your installed torch implementation to run any code.

Therefore , checkout the directory and just run:

luarocks make

Make sure your compiler is c++11 compatible ( g++4.7 or above ). Otherwise cmake will change to use the c++0x flag, which works for gcc4.6 and above.

To run it using Lua ( example ):

require "libhtktoth"
arr = {}
for i=1,100000 do
    arr[i] = i
end
writehtk("feature.plp",10000,100000,10,"PLP",arr)

which writes into the file feature.plp the feature, with 10000 samples, a sampleperiod of 100000 ( 10ns) , 10 dimensions and the PLP type is used.
Datawise we use the table arr.

The only unclear parameter is the feature type. It can be one of the following:
WAVEFORM
LPC
LPREFC
LPCEPSTRA
LPDELCEP
IREFC
MFCC
FBANK
MELSPEC
USER
DISCRETE
PLP


To load the feature simply use:

feat = loadhtk('feature.plp',1)

Here the first parameter indicates the feature name/ path and the second one indicates the Frame extension ( how many frames should be concatenated left and right )
