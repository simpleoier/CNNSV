A small script written in c++11 to write a htk file in binary.

Installation:
The precompiled library can already be used, just make sure you always copy htkwrite.so with your .lua file and that the library is in the same
directory as the to be executed .lua file.


Compiling ( if necessary ):

Just run:
make

Make sure your compiler is c++11 compatible ( g++4.7 or above ). Otherwise change the flag from std=c++11 to std=c++0x if you use g++4.6.

Testing :

run:
make test && ./testhtkwrite


To run it using Lua ( example ):

require ("htkwrite")
arr = {1,2,3,4,5}
writehtk("feature.plp",3,100000,5,"PLP",arr)

which writes into the file feature.plp the feature, with 3 samples, a sampleperiod of 100000 ( 10ns) , 5 dimensions and the PLP type is used.
Datawise we use the table arr.

The only unclear parameter is the feature type. It can be one of the following:
WAVEFORM
LPC
LPREFC
LPCEPSTRA
LPDELCEP
IREFC
MFCC
FBANK
MELSPEC
USER
DISCRETE
PLP
